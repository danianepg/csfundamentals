## Data Structures

|  | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|--|--|--|
| Arrays |  direct index; <br> easy to create and use | sorting and searching; <br>inserting and deleting - particularly if not at the start or end |
| LinkedLists |  insert/delete; <br> iterating through the collection | direct access; <br> searching and sorting |
| Stacks and Queues | designed for LIFO/FIFO | direct access; <br> searching and sorting |
| Hash Tables | speed of insertion and deletion; <br> speed of acccess | some overhead; retrieving in a sorted order; searching for specific value |
| Sets | checking if an object is in a collection; avoiding duplicates | direct access; <br> everything else |
| Binary Search Trees | speed of insertion and deletions; speed of access; maitaining sorted order | some overhead |

 *
 *         A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into x units and at each unit there may or may not exist a
 *         stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.
 *
 *         Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog is able to
 *         cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assume the first
 *         jump must be 1 unit.
 *
 *         If the frog's last jump was k units, then its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units. Note that
 *         the frog can only jump in the forward direction.
 *
 *         Note:
 *
 *         The number of stones is â‰¥ 2 and is < 1,100.
 *         Each stone's position will be a non-negative integer < 231.
 *         The first stone's position is always 0.
 *
 *         Example 1:
 *
 *         [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
 *
 *         There are a total of 8 stones.
 *         The first stone at the 0th unit, second stone at the 1st unit,
 *         third stone at the 3rd unit, and so on...
 *         The last stone at the 17th unit.
 *
 *         Return true. The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping
 *         1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then
 *         2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone,
 *         4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.
 *
 *         Example 2:
 *
 *         [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]
 *
 *         Return false. There is no way to jump to the last stone as
 *         the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.

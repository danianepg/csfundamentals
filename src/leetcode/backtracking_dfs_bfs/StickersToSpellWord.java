 * https://leetcode.com/problems/stickers-to-spell-word/
 * Hard
 *
 * @author danianepg
 *
 *         We are given N different types of stickers. Each sticker has a lowercase English word on it.
 *
 *         You would like to spell out the given target string by cutting individual letters from your collection of
 *         stickers and rearranging them.
 *
 *         You can use each sticker more than once if you want, and you have infinite quantities of each sticker.
 *
 *         What is the minimum number of stickers that you need to spell out the target? If the task is impossible,
 *         return -1.
 *
 *         Example 1:
 *
 *         Input:
 *
 *         ["with", "example", "science"], "thehat"
 *         Output:
 *
 *         3
 *         Explanation:
 *
 *         We can use 2 "with" stickers, and 1 "example" sticker.
 *         After cutting and rearrange the letters of those stickers, we can form the target "thehat".
 *         Also, this is the minimum number of stickers necessary to form the target string.
 *         Example 2:
 *
 *         Input:
 *
 *         ["notice", "possible"], "basicbasic"
 *         Output:
 *
 *         -1
 *         Explanation:
 *
 *         We can't form the target "basicbasic" from cutting letters from the given stickers.
 *         Note:
 *
 *         stickers has length in the range [1, 50].
 *         stickers consists of lowercase English words (without apostrophes).
 *         target has length in the range [1, 15], and consists of lowercase English letters.
 *         In all test cases, all words were chosen randomly from the 1000 most common US English words, and the target
 *         was chosen as a concatenation of two random words.
 *         The time limit may be more challenging than usual. It is expected that a 50 sticker test case can be solved
 *         within 35ms on average.
